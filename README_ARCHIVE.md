# Archiving Strategy Proposal for `car_snapshots` Table


Here's my high-level concept for safely archiving the `car_snapshots` table, which receives a high volume of vehicle events (10 rows/sec) and has grown to millions of entries over time.

Since the table is "insert-only" and we no longer need older data for daily use (but still want to keep it), the main goal is to **free up space and improve performance** — without losing important historical data.

## 🔧 Option 1: Row-by-Row Archiving (Manual Approach)

We can write a script to move the oldest rows (e.g., older than 1 year) from the main table into an archive table, then delete them from the original.

**Pros:**
- Simple to understand.
- Works without needing special DB features.

**Cons:**
- Deletes are slow and can lock the table.
- Risky in production due to performance impact.
- Hard to track what’s been moved already.
- Doesn’t scale well with large datasets.

## 🔧 Option 2: Write Future Data into Year-Based Tables

We can change the logic so that new incoming data gets stored in year-based or month-based tables (e.g. `car_snapshots_2025`, `car_snapshots_2026`).

**Pros:**
- Makes it easier to manage new data.
- Can separate current vs old data naturally.

**Cons:**
- Requires changes in the application logic.
- Doesn’t help clean up existing millions of old records.

---

## 🔧 Option 3: Use Partial Indexing (on Recent Data Only)

We create indexes only on recent data (e.g., last 1 year), so old data doesn't slow down lookups.

**Pros:**
- Helps improve query performance.
- Easy to implement.

**Cons:**
- Doesn’t reduce storage size.
- Doesn’t remove old data — not really an archiving solution.

## 🔧 Option 4: Use a Time-Series Extension (e.g. TimescaleDB)

If the DB is PostgreSQL, we can use an extension like [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb), which offers automatic time-based partitioning, compression, and data retention.

**Pros:**
- Very powerful for time-series data.
- Automatic chunking and retention.
- Built-in compression for old data.

**Cons:**
- Adds an external dependency.
- Might need DB migration or extensions that aren't allowed in all environments.

## ✅ Recommended Solution: Partitioning + Scheduled Archiving

The most scalable and production-safe approach is to use **time-based partitioning** (e.g., by month or year), then archive old partitions with a **scheduled background job**.

### Step 1: Time-Based Partitioning
- Break the table into partitions by month or year.
- Makes querying recent data faster and limits table size.

### Step 2: Scheduled Archival Job
- Run a daily or weekly job to:
  - Move partitions older than 1 year to an archive table or cold storage (e.g., S3).
  - Or simply detach/drop them to free up space.

**Pros:**
- Fast and safe — operates at the partition level.
- No heavy DELETEs needed.
- Easy to automate and scale.
- Keeps old data accessible, but separate.

**Cons:**
- Requires setup of partitioning.
- May require some query or schema changes.
